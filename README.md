# READMEGenerator

## Description:
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. Having a quality README is crucial as you create different applications. 

The README will answer questions regarding the app, from what is the app, how to use the app, or how to make contributions. Although there is no right way to make a README, one should provide some context to what the application will do. 


## Installation:
- Be sure to have the latest version of the NodeJs installed on your computer. 
- Download "npm install" from your terminal. This will download all the module that you will require for your application. 


## Usage:
- opening the terminal from your VS Code, you will be able to navigate to the folder in which the index.js file is located using a series of "cd <folder name>" commands
- once you are in the folder with the correct index.js, run "node index.js"
- answer the questions. NOTE: Be sure to have a valid GitHub profile to generate the badge, along with a profile picture link.
