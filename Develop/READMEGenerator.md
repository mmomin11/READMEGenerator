# READMEGENERATOR

_Repo by mmomin11

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. Having a quality README is crucial as you create different applications. The README will answer questions regarding the app, from what is the app, how to use the app, or how to make contributions. Although there is no right way to make a README, one should provide some context to what the application will do. 

---

## Installation:
NPM install NodeJS

## Usage:
Run the terminal in Visual Studio code and run Node Index.js to begin the questions to generate the README.
